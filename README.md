## Emblem Builds

# Deprecated

Emblem's come a long way since initially offering compilation within the
browser. Most if not all people use Emblem within the context of the
[ember-cli addon](https://github.com/Vestorly/ember-cli-emblem).

So, if you need/expect this repo to be updated in any way, please open
an issue and let me know in what context you're depending on this repo.
